# Recommendation-system-using-neural-collaborative-filtering

In recommendation systems collaborative filtering use the rating of

item by user to calculate similarity between users and items. The state-
of-art techniques for recommendation systems are based on latent factor

models, which aim to learn user and item embedding for rebuild interaction
matrix to predict user-item preferences.
